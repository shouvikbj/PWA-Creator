      As a full-stack PWA developer, I always felt that creating icons of
      various sizes (suitable for the manifest.json file) properly was a hecktic
      and time consuming task. And struggled almost every time to find set of
      proper sized icons. So, I felt the need of a better software that could
      help all the PWA developers like me.
      <br /><br />
      Through this app I have tried to solve the above problems. This
      application is also a PWA. It is very fluent, very fast and on top of all
      it is hassle free. The PWA logos for this app is generated through this
      app while this app was in test/development phase.
      <br /><br />
      Hopefully this App will solve a lot of time for all the PWA developers out
      there. In future hoping to add dynamic generation of set files along with
      icons that are required to make a PWA work. Will try to add the feature
      "on creating a project, you will get all the required icons, customized
      manifest, serviceWorker and the runner app".
      <br /><br />
      Till then enjoy the current App and speed up your PWA development.
