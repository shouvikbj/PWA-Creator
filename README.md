# PWA Image Creator App

As a full-stack PWA developer, I always felt that creating icons of
various sizes (suitable for the manifest.json file) properly was a hecktic
and time consuming task. And struggled almost every time to find set of
proper sized icons. So, I felt the need of a better software that could
help all the PWA developers like me.

Through this app I have tried to solve the above problems. This
application is also a PWA. It is very fluent, very fast and on top of all
it is hassle free. The PWA logos for this app is generated through this
app while this app was in test/development phase.

Hopefully this App will solve a lot of time for all the PWA developers out
there. This App generates all of set files (runner app, serviceWoeker,
manifest) along with icons that are required to make a PWA work.

Hope to add more and more features to this App in near future.

Till then enjoy the current App and speed up your PWA development.
